        <h3>1) What does this browser extension do?</h3>
        <p>As you browse the interent, this browser extension analyses the privacy policies of the sites you visit and identifies any potential breaches of your privacy. It then alerts you of any threats via the Safe Browsing Box and your dashboard in the extension, and gives you advice on how to protect your privacy.<p>
        <h3>2) Can I change which alerts I recieve?</h3>
        <p>Click on the Settings button (the small grey cog) on your dashboard to customise which alerts you recieve, and how they are delivered to you through your Safe Browsing Box. You can chose to be alerted via light, sound or movement, and further customise the colour, note and direction of movement.</p>
        <h3>3) How do I get advice about how to protect my privacy?</h3>
        <p>Click on an alert in your dashboard to recieve personalised advice for how to address that threat. </p>
        <h3>4) Will this work if I don't have my Safe Browsing Box plugged in?</h3>
        <p>You will still recieve alerts in your dashboard, but won't be notified each time you get a new alert.</p>
